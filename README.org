* qpdf.el

A [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] Emacs wrapper for [[https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf][qpdf]].

To use it you hence need Emacs, transient, and qpdf. Linux and Windows binaries for qpdf are available [[https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/releases][here]]; a homebrew formula for macOS is [[https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/qpdf][here]] (=brew install qpdf=).

Optionally, when [[https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]] is installed and the command =qpdf= is invoked from a buffer in pdf-view-mode, the default infile is set to the current file, presets for pages are shown based on the current page, and the outfile is opened in a buffer in pdf-view-mode.

To install and setup with [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]] the following can be used:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package qpdf.el
  :straight (:host github :repo "orgtre/qpdf.el")
  :commands qpdf)
#+end_src
