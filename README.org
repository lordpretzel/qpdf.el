* qpdf.el

A [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] Emacs wrapper for [[https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf][qpdf]] for use with [[https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]].

To use it you hence need Emacs, transient, pdf-tools, and qpdf. Linux and Windows binaries for qpdf are available [[https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/releases][here]]; a homebrew formula for macOS is [[https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/qpdf][here]] (=brew install qpdf=).

To install and setup with [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]] I use the following:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package qpdf.el
  :after pdf-tools
  :straight (:host github :repo "orgtre/qpdf.el")
  :commands qpdf)
#+end_src
